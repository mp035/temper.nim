# temper.nim
A Nim module to drive TEMPer1f (TEMPerX_V3.3 and similar) USB Temperature Sensors (413d:2107)

This was based on the work done on a python module at https://github.com/urwen/temper

Urwen's python module supports many more sensors, so if you want to add support for anoter sensor, take a look at Urwen's temper.py.
